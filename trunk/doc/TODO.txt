Meterman2 To-do
-----------------

== Infrastructure ==

Write MMActions: system action names will be loaded from a bundle at launch time; game actions will be loaded when the game is initialized. MMActions will be chained, much as in a BundleGroup, so games can override the system action names.

== GameManager and World Model ==

Write scripted delegate classes.

Put the current game into the game-namespace as "game".

Get rid of all the faux-parser stuff. Instead, add confirmation messages for actions that would otherwise have none.


== UI ==

Change the font used in the interface, and distribute it with the program. If someone wants to internationalize the program, he can supply a different font and hand-edit the .properties file to load it.

Add a new dialog for conversations, instead of re-using the list dialog.

Add a new dialog for the startup game list with descriptions.
